## Overview

`Webpack` is a powerful module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Webpack can handle tasks like bundling, transpiling, and optimizing your code, making it essential for modern web development.

## Features

- **Module Bundling**: Combines multiple modules into a single file, reducing the number of HTTP requests.
- **Code Splitting**: Splits your code into smaller chunks, loading only what's needed, when it's needed.
- **Loaders**: Transforms files into valid modules that Webpack can process, such as converting TypeScript to JavaScript or compiling SCSS to CSS.
- **Plugins**: Extends Webpack's capabilities by adding tasks like minification, optimization, and environment-specific configurations.
- **Dev Server**: Provides a development server with live reloading, making development faster and more efficient.
