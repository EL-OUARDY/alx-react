## Intoduction

`React` is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state, making complex UIs easier to develop and maintain.

## Key Features

- `Component-Based`: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, and compose them to create complex UIs.
- `Declarative`: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
- `Virtual DOM`: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM.
- `JSX`: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript, making the code easier to read and write.
